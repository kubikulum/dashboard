/**
 * maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.  Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren\'t allowed to remediate.  Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.  MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage. Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of the desired replicas.  If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas) under the active MachineSet\'s management.
