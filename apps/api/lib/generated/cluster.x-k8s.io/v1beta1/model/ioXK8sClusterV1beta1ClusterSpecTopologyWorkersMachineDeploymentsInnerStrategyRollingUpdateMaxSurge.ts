/**
 * The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the desired number of machines. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired machines (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.
