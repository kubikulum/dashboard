/**
 * The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired machines (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 0. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring that the total number of machines available at all times during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.
