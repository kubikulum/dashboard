FailureReason will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose string suitable for logging and human consumption.  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate\'s spec or the configuration of the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the controller\'s output.
